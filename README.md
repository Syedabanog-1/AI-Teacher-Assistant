AI-Powered Q&A
Students can ask subject-related questions, and AI responds according to their academic level.

Dynamic Options

⚙️ Workflow

Program starts → Student Profile is collected.

Profile is displayed in JSON format.

If a question is asked → AI responds using the student’s profile context.

If subject or student is changed → System updates the profile.

Loop continues until user quits.
